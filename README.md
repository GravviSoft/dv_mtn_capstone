# Lead Factory React App

After cloning the project follow these steps:

```bash
cd server
touch .env
```

Copy and past the following into your .env file.  Make sure your connection string contains your unique postgresql database information.

  ```bash
PORT_NUM=5000
CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname]
```

After your env file is set up you can now download the server packages and start the server.

```bash
npm install
npm start server
```

Open another terminal in the main directory of the application(my-app).  Download React packages and start the app.
